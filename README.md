# BetterCloud_Exercise
Customer Portal Application for use as a candidate screening exercise. 

Please write an ASP.NET MVC application that allows a user to perform CRUD operations on Customer information on a web page.
The application should save the data to a database of your choice.
Take the Address Information from the Customer Information and save the Longitude and Latitude using Google's Geocoding API.
Use proper architectural layering / patterns.
Write the unit / integration tests for each layer.
NUGET packages are acceptable but please do not use any frameworks/utilities that you have previously written (unless you can re-write them within the timeframe).
Write a little excerpt as to what architectural / layering decisions you made, why you made the decisions, and alternatives you rejected and why.
